            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Gikonyo Omoga. Iâ€™m a learner at Power Learn Project, learning how to code. My passion for coding came after reading too much on cyber security, and I saw how easy it is for anyone to see your data. Ever since that day and after reading many more articles on Cyber Security, I wanted to learn how to protect myself online. But we have to start somewhere in coding, and this is my first coding project. I will continue building my coding skills in Databases, Python, and HTML so that when I start learning about Cyber Security, I will have the muscle memory, mental capability, and the drive to go through the course.</p>
            <p>What drives me? A thirst for knowledge not just in coding but in many things in life in general.</p>
